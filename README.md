# Mica for Everyone!
Mica For Everyone is a tool to customize system backdrop on win32 apps using [DwmSetWindowAttribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/dwmapi/nf-dwmapi-dwmsetwindowattribute) and other methods.
It can apply Mica (or any other backdrop material) on non-client area (window frame) or background of supported apps and its behavior is customizable through a GUI and a config file.
